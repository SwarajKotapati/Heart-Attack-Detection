# Heart-Attack-Detection-
Designed using Machine Learning concepts which use parameters: Serum Creatinine and Ejection Fraction to predict the risk of heart attack


How did we do it ?

1. We have trained a binary classifier and saved the model to 'model.pkl'
2. Loading the saved model using scikit model
3. Input from the user in the form of (ejection fraction, serum creatinine) is fed to the model
4. The classifier predicts the risk of heart attack


Here's a concise overview of the code

- We are collecting the input parameters to the model using a webpage designed using Bootstrap4.
- The result predicted by the model is then displayed in the form of a webpage.
